# Third-Party APIs Work Day Scheduler

## Description

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively. This project will demonstrate creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


## Usage 

- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

- WHEN I scroll down THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.

- WHEN I view the timeblocks for that dayTHEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

- WHEN I click into a timeblock THEN I can enter an event.

- WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

- WHEN I refresh the page THEN the saved events persist.
